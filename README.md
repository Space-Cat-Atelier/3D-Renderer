## How to use
Well first you need some prerequisites. First of all, you need python installed, which can be done easily (If you're installing python for the first time, make sure to also include pip).
Next, in your CMD, run `python -m pip install pygame-ce`.


Now open up a fresh CMD to the path of `3D Renderer.py`.

To render your own obj file, run `python "3D Renderer.py" "path/to/your/object_file.obj"` and a window will show up showing you an area with your 3D object in it.

If the path to your 3D object doesn't exist, or you don't provide it with a path, the empty area instead shows an apple.
