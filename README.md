# 3D Renderer
A 3D Renderer made in Python using the Pygame module.

This project took quite some time to comlpete, but here it is! You use the WASD keys to move around, UP and DOWN keys to move forward and backward, and LEFT and RIGHT keys to turn. You can also upload your own .obj files into this as well.

Overall, I think I did a pretty good job on this!

Here is a screenshot of me using an .obj file of an apple:
